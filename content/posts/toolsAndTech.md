## As a tech nerd I'd like to use Apple products.

# 📱 Phone
But I didn't yet switched fully to the apple products, like my Android phone.
Some features make me stay with Android, like extra apps and super customizibility. 
But I would like to have some features that apple offers: like iMessage, seamless synchronization between devices, AirDrop.

# 📝 Notetaking/Fleeting notes
I use the cheapest notebook and mechanical pencil with eraser. I take temporary notes with pencil, but for things that should be kept for a longterm - iPad with pencil is a my choice.
